      <h1>The Horses of Mausolus</h1>
      
      <p>In the Ancient Greek section of the museum you will find a horse's head. It belongs to a horse which use to stand (with three friends) atop the Mausoleum of Halikarnassos, the tomb of the tyrant Mausolus</p>
      
      <p>The horse stands quietly with its head held down and turned to its left. It conveys a sense of great energy and vitality shown by the bulging muscles, flaring nostrils, open mouth, prominent veins and bulbous right eye.</p>
